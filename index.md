### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because I found utilizing command line arguments to be very fun. The code wasn't too long and hefty, but managed to run an entire program that could make a sandwich using a user's line arguments. It was very easy and fun to make.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was another favorite of mine as I found the use of if statements to be really enjoyable. This was also our first lab that was in the form of a game, so I thought it was awesome being able to write one that functions and also provides errors that help out the player.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 is my third favorite lab as I liked how it strayed away from being a useful program and rather a more visually pleasing program. I feel that this part helped me deeply understand for loops better and how it can be used.
